# Shape Manifold Embedding

Run <code>2-ShapeManifoldEmbedding > RunShapeManifoldEmbedding.m</code>, which asks for the Analysis folder as input and gives the user the option of using sparse decomposition.

Once correctly completed, a file called <code>CellShapeData.mat</code> is created in the Analysis folder

This process is relatively slow: for a set of 4000 shapes, it takes about 8 minutes, while for 37818 shapes, the calculations require about 31 hours, approximately 1.5 to 2 days. The sparse implementation is much faster, requiring only 5 hours for 37818 shapes. It uses MATLAB's [eigs](https://uk.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/eigs.html) function rather than [eig](https://uk.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/eig.html). It is correct up to a +/- sign. This effects how the data is viewed in shape space but does not effect any subsequent measurements.
